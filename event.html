	<p class="eventp"> Irish traditional music (also known as Irish trad, Irish folk music, and other variants) is a genre of folk music that developed in Ireland.
In A History of Irish Music (1905), W. H. Grattan Flood wrote that, in Gaelic Ireland, there were at least ten instruments in general use. These were the cruit (a small harp) and clairseach (a bigger harp with typically 30 strings), the timpan (a small string instrument played with a bow or plectrum), the feadan (a fife), the buinne (an oboe or flute), the guthbuinne (a bassoon-type horn), the bennbuabhal and corn (hornpipes), the cuislenna (bagpipes – see Great Irish Warpipes), the stoc and sturgan (clarions or trumpets), and the cnamha (castanets).[1] There is also evidence of the fiddle being used in the 8th century.[1]
There are several collections of Irish folk music from the 18th century, but it was not until the 19th century that ballad printers became established in Dublin. Important collectors include Colm Ó Lochlainn, George Petrie, Edward Bunting, Francis O'Neill, James Goodman and many others. Though solo performance is preferred in the folk tradition, bands or at least small ensembles have probably been a part of Irish music since at least the mid-19th century, although this is a point of much contention among ethnomusicologists. </p>

	"I travelled to Cahir to see these guys on their debut tonight. Said I'd go in for a half hour but could not leave until they finished. Brilliant young group with a great range of music and some top class instrumental stuff also. Look forward to hearing them again soon. Some good old time session music and songs we all know. Well done Cathal Boyle and the Murphy's. You can have a bright future ahead."<span class="am">-A.Moloney</span>
